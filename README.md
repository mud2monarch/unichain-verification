# Trustless verification of Unichain transactions
I have a theory that many people simply do not trust L2s. They think they're insecure and susceptible to the operator manipulating user assets.

This is not true. It's possible to take a transaction hash, which is generated by your own wallet, and cryptographically prove the transaction was executed by the L2 and posted to L1.

This repo is a program, later a website, that takes a trusted transaction hash and demonstrates each of these steps.

This is, in many ways, a more verbose re-implementation of Noah Citron's [helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) light client.
